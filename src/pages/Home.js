                <p>
                    I am a Computer Support Professional II. I love problem solving, which is why I have
                    been attracted to programming. I started programming at the age of 10 by
                    teaching myself BasicII. Over the years I learned newer languages. I have been building and utilizing my
                    skills over the last 20 years at my current job. I have written numerous web applications, 
                    programing scripts for server applications, designed websites, mentored numerous student programming assitants,
                    and provide database administration on top of my other job functions. I am currently enrolled in a 
                    full stack developer boot camp.
